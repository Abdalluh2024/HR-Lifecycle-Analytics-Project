# 📊 HR Lifecycle Analytics Project
This project focuses on analyzing the full employee lifecycle within an organization using Excel. The goal is to uncover trends related to employee turnover, performance, engagement, and promotions to help HR departments make data-driven decisions.
## 📁 Project Files
- `HR_Lifecycle_Analytics_Project.xlsx`: Cleaned dataset with 250 employees covering demographics, job info, training, performance, and exit reasons.
- `HR_Lifecycle_Dashboard.xlsx`: Interactive dashboard summarizing key insights using PivotTables, charts, and visual summaries.
- `images/`: Screenshots of key charts and metrics.
## 🧰 Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel
- PivotTables
- Conditional Formatting
- Charts & Visualization
- HR Analytics Logic
## 📌 Key Metrics Analyzed
- Turnover Rate by Department
- Reasons for Leaving
- Performance Score vs. Resignation
- Training Hours vs. Performance
- Engagement Score vs. Resignation
- Promotion vs. Resignation
## 📈 Key Insights
1. **Highest Turnover in HR & IT departments**, exceeding 45%.
2. Top reasons for resignation: *Better Opportunity* and *Low Salary*.
3. High-performing employees (Score 4–5) also had **high resignation rates** (48–54%), indicating dissatisfaction even among top talent.
4. Promotion does **not guarantee retention** — even employees with 1–2 promotions resigned at a ~50% rate.
5. Employees with low **Engagement Scores (<5)** had a **50%+ chance of resigning**.
6. High training hours did **not directly translate into improved performance or retention**.
## ✅ Recommendations
- Monitor engagement regularly to flag early resignation risk.
- Improve documentation for exit interviews (35+ resignations had no recorded reason).
- Rethink the impact of training programs — focus on quality, not just quantity.
- Offer clear career paths and recognition, especially for high performers.
